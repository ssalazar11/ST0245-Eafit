 *This is our data structure, Octree. This will be responsible for positioning each bee in a specific quadrant,

 *If more than one bee is found in a quadrant, this quadrant will be divided into multiple subOctrees, found 
 *in the limits of this, until the bee is alone, or within a diagonal quadrant of less than 100 meters in length. 
 *This is done to ensure that all the bees within this quadrant are in danger of colliding.
